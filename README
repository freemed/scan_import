README

This is the FreeMED Scan Import daemon. It is run as a cronjob every minute
and uses the FreeMED 0.9.x+ data relay to push djvu encoded copies of source
material into a FreeMED install. It is configured by freemed.ini in the
install directory.

INSTALLATION

* Install a copy of FreeMED::Relay from Subversion or a Debian package, along
  with libjson-perl, libconfig-inifiles-perl, libsys-syslog-perl,
  djvulibre-bin, python-uno.

* Make sure you have a working copy of gsdjvu installed on your system.
  FreeMED comes with a script to automate the build and install process.
  (The gsdjvu executable should be symlinked into /usr/bin/ for it to
  function from cron properly)

* If you do not have a copy of djvudigital installed on your system, copy
  the version from FreeMED into /usr/bin/ and make it executable.

* Install this directory in /usr/share/scan_import on the server which
  will be running Scan Import.

* Set up a headless instance of openoffice if you're using DOC/ODT import.
  See: http://www.artofsolving.com/node/10 , an example is:
    soffice -headless -accept="socket,host=127.0.0.1,port=8100;urp;" -nofirststartwizard

* Create a cron fragment to run this every minute, like this:
  * * * * * root /usr/share/scan_import/cronjob.sh 2>&1 | logger -t scan_import
  and put it in your /etc/cron.d/ directory. Reload cron so this is picked
  up.

README

This is the FreeMED Scan Import daemon. It is run as a cronjob every minute
and uses the FreeMED 0.9.x+ data relay to push djvu encoded copies of source
material into a FreeMED install. It is configured by freemed.ini in the
install directory.

INSTALLATION

* Install a copy of FreeMED::Relay from Subversion or a Debian package, along
  with libjson-perl, libconfig-inifiles-perl, libsys-syslog-perl,
  djvulibre-bin.

* Make sure you have a working copy of gsdjvu installed on your system.
  FreeMED comes with a script to automate the build and install process.

* If you do not have a copy of djvudigital installed on your system, copy
  the version from FreeMED into /usr/bin/ and make it executable.

* Install this directory in /usr/share/scan_import on the server which
  will be running Scan Import.

This is the FreeMED Scan Import daemon. It uses FAM (file alteration monitor)
to track when files are transfered into its watch directory, then imports
them into a FreeMED 0.9.x+ install via the data relay. It does not have to
exist on the same machine as the FreeMED install. Its configuration file is
freemed.ini in the same directory as the daemon.

The daemon takes a single argument, which is the directory to be watched.

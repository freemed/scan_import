This is a "connector" allowing the scan_import utility to be used with
scanbuttond scanners.

Under Debian testing, it requires the following dependencies:

 * Working/running copy of FreeMED 0.9.x
   If you don't have this, your documents simply won't go anywhere.

 * scan_import and FreeMED::Relay
   Check these out of Subversion (you can also grab FreeMED::Relay from
   CPAN if you so desire):
     svn co http://svn.freemedsoftware.org/freemed-utilities/scan_import/trunk scan_import
     svn co http://svn.freemedsoftware.org/freemed-utilities/libfreemed/trunk/perl FreeMED_Perl
   scan_import has to be installed in /usr/share/scan_import for any of
   this to work. 

 * gsdjvu
   If you don't know how to install this, there's a build script under
   "scripts" in FreeMED which does it for you.

 * Debian dependencies:
   djvulibre-bin
   libconfig-inifiles-perl
   libtiff-tools
   imagemagick
   make
   netpbm
   sane
   sane-utils
   scanbuttond

== INSTALLATION PROCEDURE ==

(Please note, this is for Debian testing, if you're using anything besides
Debian or Ubuntu or another Debian derivative, you're on your own.)

1) Install all dependencies, including scanbuttond and scan_import.

2) Install the init script:

   cp scanbuttond /etc/init.d/ -v
   update-rc.d scanbuttond defaults

3) Copy "buttonpressed.sh" to "/etc/scanbuttond/buttonpressed.sh"

4) Try to manually run scanimage or xsane to verify that your scanner is
   indeed setup.

5) Edit the freemed.ini file in /usr/share/scan_import/ so that it has
   correct values for your FreeMED installation.

6) Start the daemon.

   /etc/init.d/scanbuttond start

You should now be able to press the scan key and have scanned documents
directly imported into your "Unfiled Documents" in FreeMED.

This is a quick bit of documentation explaining how to get scan key scanning
working for a Brother MFC device under Linux.

Under Debian testing, it requires the following dependencies:

 * brscan / brscan2
   These are the Brother maintained SANE drivers, and can be downloaded from
   http://solutions.brother.com/linux/sol/printer/linux/sane_drivers.html
   Please make sure to pick the proper driver for your MFC device.

 * brscan-skey
   This is also available from the Brother SANE driver download page, and
   acts as a daemon. If your Brother says "Check connection" when you hit
   the scan key, this thing isn't running.

 * Working/running copy of FreeMED 0.9.x
   If you don't have this, your documents simply won't go anywhere.

 * scan_import and FreeMED::Relay
   Check these out of Subversion (you can also grab FreeMED::Relay from
   CPAN if you so desire):
     svn co http://svn.freemedsoftware.org/freemed-utilities/scan_import/trunk scan_import
     svn co http://svn.freemedsoftware.org/freemed-utilities/libfreemed/trunk/perl FreeMED_Perl
   scan_import has to be installed in /usr/share/scan_import for any of
   this to work. 

 * gsdjvu
   If you don't know how to install this, there's a build script under
   "scripts" in FreeMED which does it for you.

 * Debian dependencies:
   djvulibre-bin
   libconfig-inifiles-perl
   libtiff-tools
   imagemagick
   make
   netpbm
   sane
   sane-utils

== INSTALLATION PROCEDURE ==

(Please note, this is for Debian testing, if you're using anything besides
Debian or Ubuntu or another Debian derivative, you're on your own.)

1) Install all dependencies, including brscan-skey and the brscan driver,
   as well as the scan_import pieces.

2) Install the init script:

   cp brscan-skey /etc/init.d/ -v
   update-rc.d brscan-skey defaults

3) Do a "make install" to push the scripts to the correct location on your
   system.

4) Run brsaneconfig2 to configure your scanner. (Please note that this step
   is *crucial*, otherwise the MFC device will not see the machine.)

5) Try to manually run scanimage or xsane to verify that your scanner is
   indeed setup.

6) Edit the freemed.ini file in /usr/share/scan_import/ so that it has
   correct values for your FreeMED installation.

7) Start the daemon.

   /etc/init.d/brscan-skey start

You should now be able to press the scan key, choose "OCR", and have scanned
documents directly imported into your "Unfiled Documents" in FreeMED.
